    - name: Run CPack (Optional -> If you want to create installers/packages)
      # This step assumes you have CPack configuration in your CMakeLists.txt
      # and that your Linux build will produce a .deb, .rpm, .tar.gz or AppImage
      # For AppImage, you might need to install appimagetool or use a specific action.
      # Example for a simple .tar.gz or .deb if configured in CMake:
      run: cmake --build ${{github.workspace}}/build --target package
      working-directory: ${{github.workspace}}/build # CPack usually runs from build directory

    # Optional: Packaging the application for distribution (e.g., AppImage, tar.gz)
    # This will depend on your CMake setup for packaging.
    - name: Package Linux Application
      # Example: create a tar.gz of your built application directory
      # This assumes your built executable and its dependencies are in a 'build/bin' or similar folder.
      # You need to adjust 'your_app_name' and the path.
      run: |
        # Use linuxdeploy or appimagetool if you want to create an AppImage
        # For a simple tar.gz:
        cd ${{github.workspace}}/build
        # Assume your application is built into a directory like 'build/your_app_name_dir'
        # You'll likely need to use windeployqt/macdeployqt/linuxdeployqt equivalent or manual packaging here.
        # This is a placeholder; you'll need to detail your specific packaging steps.
        # For a simple example:
        mkdir staged_app
        cp -r bin/your_app_executable staged_app/ # Copy your executable
        # Use ldd to find runtime dependencies and copy them to staged_app if not static
        # For Qt apps, you typically use linuxdeployqt or a similar tool for proper bundling
        # If your build produces a self-contained folder:
        # cp -r your_built_app_folder staged_app/
        tar -czvf dist_linux.tar.gz -C . staged_app # Example: create a tar.gz of the staged app
        # If you used CPack, the package might already be in the build directory, e.g., .deb, .rpm
        # For example, if CPack creates an AppImage named 'your_app_name.AppImage'
        # cp your_app_name.AppImage .
      working-directory: ${{github.workspace}}/build # Run packaging from build directory
      # This step heavily depends on how you configure your Linux deployment.
      # You might use linuxdeployqt for AppImages, or simply tar up the necessary files.
      # The `dist_linux.tar.gz` is a placeholder for your final artifact.
